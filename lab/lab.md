# Building ML Projects

This week, you will gather in groups of 3 people (not necessarily your project groups) and develop projects for different sets of data.  Each following topic includes links to one or more datasets; your job is to develop three proposal ideas using these (or other) data.  For each proposal, the process should be the same:

1. Pick an area, and examine the data? What sort of analyses are possible? Is the data sufficient and of high quality?  Do you have concerns?
current inventory, and h

2. Identify your stakeholder groups and their needs. You'll need to envision your likely stakeholder groups, and try to align their needs with the data? Does this lead you to a need for other data?  Is that data available?

3. State your objective
find which vaccine is mostly popular.
4. Discuss your modeling approach.  Are there any specific considerations for preprocessing?  Do you anticipate multiple modeling steps?
linear, when will the inflation happen. 

5. Do you think this is good project to pursue?  Why or why not?

You will have 15 minutes for each proposal idea, after which we will discuss these ideas as a class.
